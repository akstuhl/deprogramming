In [_Hungry Listening: Resonant Theory for Indigenous Sound Studies_](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/hungry-listening), sound and visual studies scholar Dylan Robinson critiques a settler-colonial tendency to collect and decontextualize Indigenous music under the banner of reconciliation. The book's third chapter addresses this problem in the contexts of a broadcast radio event and concert programming. Throughout _Hungry Listening_, Robinson builds on the event score form to imagine and encourage encounters that can reveal and redress the harms of misguided efforts to harmonize Indigenous sounds with settler structures. These event scores, including the one that concludes chapter 3 ("Event Score for Those Who Hold Our Songs"), might be called a means of deprogramming sonic arts institutions in order to dispel colonial modes of listening.
