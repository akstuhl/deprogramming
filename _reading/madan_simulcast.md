For "[Simulcast 1.0: Saskatoon](https://wavefarm.org/radio/swr/schedule/xgebf9)," four sound and radio artists -- Martine H. Crispo, GX Jupitter-Larsen, Magali Babin, and Harold Schellinx -- each contributed a week of multi-hour broadcasts that aired overnight across April 2008. Curator Emmanual Madan explained in his description for the piece that this durational mode of broadcasting intervened in radio's rigidly programmed temporal grids: "Put simply, radio broadcasting today is an almost exclusively rhythmic affair."
