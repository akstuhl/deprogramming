For "[Simulcast 1.0: Saskatoon](https://wavefarm.org/radio/swr/schedule/xgebf9)," four sound and radio artists -- Martine H. Crispo, GX Jupitter-Larsen, Magali Babin, and Harold Schellinx -- each contributed a week of multi-hour broadcasts that aired overnight across April 2008. In a description for the work, curator Emmanual Madan reflects on how this durational mode of broadcasting can intervene in radio's rigidly programmed temporal grids: "Put simply, radio broadcasting today is an almost exclusively rhythmic affair.... 'Simulcast 1.0b : Saskatoon' proposes to renew radio's link with eternity."
