The first chapter in historian Shawn VanCour's [_Making Radio: Early Radio Production and the Rise of Modern Sound Culture_](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/making-radio-9780190497118?cc=us&lang=en&) asks a narrow but consequential question: how did "scheduling strategies" in the 1920s contribute to the success of commercial radio and a larger "commodification of sound?" VanCour's research focuses on the internal producers and objects in a middle level of the radio medium that had been overlooked both by top-down (lionizing executives and inventors) and by more bottom-up (restoring listeners' and performers' agency) approaches. These workers and materials include radio programmers and the paper technology of the program log, which VanCour argues was a key element in stabilizing early radio into a medium.
