In "The Intertribal Drum of Radio: The _Indians for Indians Hour_ and Native American Media, 1941-1951," historian Josh Garrett-Davis examines the local and broader cultural impact of radio programmer [Don Whistler](listening#the-indians-for-indians-radio-hour). The article attends to Whistler's surrounding career and follows an auditory approach to understanding his innovations. Garrett-Davis writes that in "[c]reating _Indians for Indians_, Whistler turned from the mainstream toward the intertribal studio, where he used modern technology to build a cultural as well as political sovereignty behind walls that muffled what we might call the colonial _din_" (p. 268) of most media outlets' representations of Indigenous people.
