In a post for the sound studies blog _Sounding Out!_, Alejandra Bronfman briefly surveys major points from her subsequent book [_Isles of Noise: Sonic Media in the Caribbean_](https://uncpress.org/book/9781469628691/isles-of-noise/). As with the other entries in its containing "Radio de Acci√≥n" series on _SO!_, Bronfman's post highlights moments when radio was the means and target of often violent political action.
