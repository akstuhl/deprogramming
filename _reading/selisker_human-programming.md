Literary historian Scott Selisker's book [_Human Programming: Brainwashing, Automatons, and American Unfreedom_](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/human-programming) is a "cultural history of the idea of the programmable mind in U.S. culture." Its third chapter traces how computer programming, increasingly visible as a cultural force during and after the Cold War, reanimated existing anxieties about the "human automaton." Selisker uses cultural representations to connect cybernetics, posthumanism, and racist tropes of "techno-Orientalism." The chapter adds useful context for the period in North American media when more listeners and artists were growing concerned with what we might call radio's increasing _automatedness_.
