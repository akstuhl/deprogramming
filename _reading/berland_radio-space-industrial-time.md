Published in the journal _Popular Music_, Jody Berland's "Radio space and industrial time: music formats, local narratives and technological mediation" explains how the radio format -- understood as "a complex set of rules for programming" (p. 181) -- had segmented and standardized sonic culture in contrast with radio's relation to local space. Published in 1990 and focusing on the Canadian broadcast radio landscape, Berland's article also gives us a fuller sense of the same critical context in which [Radio Naked](listening#radio-naked) was produced.
