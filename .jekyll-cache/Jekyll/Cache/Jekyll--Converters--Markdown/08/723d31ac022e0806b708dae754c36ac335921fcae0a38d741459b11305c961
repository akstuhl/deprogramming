I"*<p>In this short clip, the celebrated 1970s music radio personality The Black Pope insists to listeners that he transcends the “disc jockey” category. Shelley Pope’s contributions to the Black radio community in Alabama are documented by the <a href="http://thebbrm.org/item/441">Birmingham Black Radio Museum</a>. This recording has circulated, with an unfortunate degree of ironic distance, through largely white freeform radio and culture jamming scenes. Hearing Pope instead through the context of Birmingham’s intense intramural radio rivalries, we can ask what it would mean to take him literally when he declares that he is not a DJ but rather “a human radio station.” One interpretation hears Pope as a radio programmer merging with and subsuming the technical apparatus whose parts he lists off, anticipating by several decades the kind of bodily-electrical figurations that <a href="reading.html#the-r-the-a-the-d-the-i-the-o-the-media-ecology-of-pirate-radio">Matthew Fuller</a> would use to comprehend pirate radio’s intermedial flows.</p>
