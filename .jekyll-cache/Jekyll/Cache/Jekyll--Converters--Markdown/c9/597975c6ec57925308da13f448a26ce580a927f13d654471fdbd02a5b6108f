I"<p><a href="https://christofmigone.com/radionaked/">Radio Naked</a> is a “manifesto that naively impels the radio programmer to dispense (or at least question) all of the conventions and expectations of what radio should sound like.” Radio artist Christof Migone composed the twenty-two prompts that make up the work in the early 1990s, and audio versions were later produced for each prompt. Radio Naked lends a key precedent to this workshop, providing form and inspiration for the deprogramming prompts we will develop together.</p>
