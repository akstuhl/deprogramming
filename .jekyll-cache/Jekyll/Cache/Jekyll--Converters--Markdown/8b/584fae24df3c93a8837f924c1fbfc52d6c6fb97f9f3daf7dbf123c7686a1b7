I"Ÿ<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.GIGA">St.GIGA</a> is considered the worldâ€™s first digital satellite radio station. Director Hiroshi Yokoi developed a radical broadcast methodology - St.GIGAâ€™s broadcasts initially followed no externally fixed timetable. Rather, broadcast themes were approximately matched to the current <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7eLivrz7HE">tidal cycle</a> throughout the 24-hour broadcasting period. Under this innovative schedule, the station broadcast a variety of primarily ambient music programs, various jazz programs, and live sound-broadcasts of the ocean shore. Between 1995 and 2000, St. GIGA partnered with Nintendo to broadcast video game-related programming to owners of the Super Famicon Satellaview peripheral - this included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCHRDi-NWVA">video games that could only be played during the live broadcast schedule.</a></p>
