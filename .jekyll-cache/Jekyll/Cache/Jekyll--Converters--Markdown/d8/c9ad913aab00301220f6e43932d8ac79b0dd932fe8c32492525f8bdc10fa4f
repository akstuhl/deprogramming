<p>by Julia Steinmetz</p>

<p><em>For pairs or groups over telephone or video chat</em></p>

<p>Begin by listening for your own heartbeat.</p>

<p>Is it a sound or a sensation?</p>

<p>Tap your teeth together. Swallow.</p>

<p>Are you hearing with your ears or your mouth?</p>

<p>Slowly run your finger over the edges of the curves of your ear.</p>

<p>Are you listening to a sound or a texture?</p>

<p>Remember a time when you felt sound with your whole body: on the surface of your skin, in your muscles, in your bones.</p>

<p>Now think of a sound you would like someone else to feel.</p>

<p>Put your fingers against the surface of your headphones or speakers.</p>

<p>Get ready to touch and be touched by sound.</p>

<p>When you are ready, release a sound for others to feel.</p>

<p>Alternate listening with your fingertips and sending out sounds for others to touch and feel.</p>

<p>Allow your focus to glide across the the relational network of sonic
textures.</p>
