I"ë<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<p>Our workshop got off to a great start thanks to 28 enthusiastic attendees. Much of the time was spent introducing ourselves and collaboratively building a list of associations with the word ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù in a <a href="https://jamboard.google.com/d/1Gk1Bo4FXmAjhrLCndq83GvV5XeN5Gnrf4Fs8X_jlfPY/edit?usp=sharing">jamboard</a>. Here‚Äôs some of what we came up with, which I‚Äôve loosely reordered to start with the more imagistic associations, moving into the more abstract and then aspirational ideas about what programming and deprogramming could become.</p>

<ul>
  <li>paper programs at events</li>
  <li>automation and clocks (in radio); constraint</li>
  <li>music synthesizer programming ‚Äì creating patches and presets</li>
  <li>formats</li>
  <li>the sound story of a radio station</li>
  <li>recorded voice as material in radio</li>
  <li>concerts: what is played for an audience; who gets to make decisions about who + what is listened to</li>
  <li>web programming ‚Äì creating input/output structure</li>
  <li>how we interface with machines on their own terms</li>
  <li>tennis metaphor: sending something and seeing what comes back</li>
  <li>straight line, linear, Terminator robots!</li>
  <li>centralized control of peripherals to make something specific happen</li>
  <li>something pre-ordained, or pre-organized</li>
  <li>biological processes, DNA</li>
  <li>organizing (thoughts and content)</li>
  <li>going to work</li>
  <li>sterile</li>
  <li>rationalization</li>
  <li>manufacturing consent</li>
  <li>repetition, predictability, reliability</li>
  <li>hospitality</li>
  <li>anticipating the listener experience ‚Äì who is the audience?</li>
  <li>developing other artists‚Äô work ‚Äì listening</li>
  <li>developing seamless inclusivity and inspiration</li>
  <li>rethinking and understanding radio editing/producing</li>
  <li>using multimedia and found media (e.g. voicemails)</li>
  <li>historical exploration</li>
  <li>structure, order; re-thinking and interrupting that</li>
  <li>dechronoprogramming and morphomoving</li>
  <li>deprogramming to face the mass media</li>
  <li>deprogramming and/as decolonization</li>
</ul>

<p>In the latter part of the session, a mini-lecture walked through five senses of ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù to do give a historical overview of how this notion has developed in and alongside American radio. The slides from this presentation are <a href="/assets/session-1-slides.pdf">here</a>.</p>
