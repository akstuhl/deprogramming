<h2 id="preparing">Preparing</h2>

<p>Please take a listen through the works in our <a href="/listening.html">listening syllabus</a> in advance of the second session. The audio player at the top of that page will automatically loop through the recorded Radio Naked prompts and some other syllabus excerpts, which might be a good way to background-listen while you wash dishes. I recommend also reading through the text version of Radio Naked.</p>

<p>If you missed the first session or would like a refresher, also please take a look at the <a href="february-07.html">recap</a>.</p>
