<p>Most of the session was spent working our way through a list of 46 deprogramming prompts that we had so far generated. We heard each participant read the prompts they had drafted, after which the group offered reactions and questions.</p>

<p>With our remaining time, we discussed production tools and conceptual strategies as we prepared to create audio interpretations of each other’s prompts.</p>

<p>In advance of our third session, please draft three short deprogramming prompts (you are welcome to draft more if inspiration strikes). Please send these by <a href="mailto:andykstuhl@gmail.com">email</a> before noon on Monday, Feb. 21 so that we can all view each other’s work in the session.</p>

<p>Your prompts can address radio or any medium / combination of media you choose. Do not worry if you feel you don’t “get” the format yet: now is the time to experiment and cast a wide net as to how we want to shape this project.</p>

<p>If you are feeling confused, would like some help in drafting your prompts, or otherwise just want to chat, I’ve set up a <a href="https://calendly.com/andy-stuhl/30min">Calendly</a> page to schedule one on one meetings. We’ll use the same Zoom link for these as for the workshop sessions. If you would be interested in meeting as a small group with other participants, please email me and let me know your timezone + general availability and I will try to put folks in touch.</p>
