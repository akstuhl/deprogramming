I"O<p>In 1966 and 1967, New York City station WBAI hosted a series of relaxed, informal, one-on-one conversations between composers John Cage and Morton Feldman. In the first of these “<a href="https://www.ubu.com/sound/cage_feldman.html">Radio Happenings</a>,” Cage explains how his experience of the radio medium changed after using it as a compositional tool. He also (around 22:50 in the recording) describes an attitude toward sounds and their effects on listeners that we will consider as a type of programming. This cybernetic approach to experimental composition was expanded by other artists including Pauline Oliveros (<a href="https://akstuhl.net/blog/2016-12-12-oliveros.html">here</a> are some longer thoughts on Oliveros and the computational arts context), and it offers one precedent for our artistic stance of deprogramming.</p>
