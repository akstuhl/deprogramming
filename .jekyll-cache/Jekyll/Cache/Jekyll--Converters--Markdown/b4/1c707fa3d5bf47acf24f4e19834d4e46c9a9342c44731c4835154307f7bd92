<h2 id="preparing">Preparing</h2>

<p>Please take a listen through the works in our <a href="/listening.html">listening syllabus</a> in advance of the second session. The audio player at the top of that page will automatically loop through the recorded Radio Naked prompts and some other syllabus excerpts, which might be a good way to background-listen while you wash dishes. I recommend also reading through the text version of Radio Naked.</p>

<p>If you missed the first session or would like a refresher, also please take a look at the <a href="february-07.html">recap</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deprogramming-non-radio-media-exercise-breakout-rooms">Deprogramming non-radio media exercise (breakout rooms)</h2>

<p>Your task with your group is to draft at least one “deprogramming prompt,” in the style of Radio Naked, for the medium assigned to the breakout room you choose.</p>

<p>Here are some questions that may be useful to pose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What makes someone a “programmer” for this medium?</li>
  <li>What are some routines that are always followed in this medium?</li>
  <li>What’s a routine that would be interesting to question or disrupt? How would the programmer do that? What would it look/sound/feel like?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for-next-session">For next session</h2>

<p>In advance of our third session, please draft three short deprogramming prompts. Please send these by <a href="mailto:andykstuhl@gmail.com">email</a> before noon on Monday, Feb. 21 so that we can all view each other’s work in the session.</p>

<p>Your prompts can address radio or any medium / combination of media you choose. Do not worry if you feel you don’t “get” the format yet: now is the time to experiment and cast a wide net as to how we want to shape this project. We’ll all have the chance to refine our drafts based on collective feedback.</p>
