I"1<p>In her contribution to <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/1924/Software-StudiesA-Lexicon"><em>Software Studies: A Lexicon</em></a>, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun explains how the notion of programmability split off from other meanings of “program” (including its broadcast usage) to co-evolve with the electronic computer. Chun is a new media scholar with backgrounds in both literature and systems design engineering, and her brief chapter dives deep into the semiotic differences between analog and digital computing. For our purposes, the entry provides a good overview of how the computing sense of programming overlaps and diverges with other contexts. It also, at the end, points toward a possible death of programming in one sense as programmability and control adapt to new scientific developments.</p>
