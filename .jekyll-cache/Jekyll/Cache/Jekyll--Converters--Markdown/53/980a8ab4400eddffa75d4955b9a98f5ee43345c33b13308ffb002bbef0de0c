I"O<p>From its start in 1941 into the 1970s, the <a href="https://wavefarm.org/wf/archive/d934qy">Indians for Indians Radio Hour</a> was a vital presence on the airwaves of University of Oklahoma station WNAD and in the social fabric of Indigenous communities that intersected the station’s broadcast area. Whistler, a chief of the Sac and Fox Nation who also went by the name Kesh-ke-kosh, offers us a model of the radio programmer as cultural convener. His approach departed from and at times playfully critiqued the authoritative conventions of talk programming and pop music on network radio at the time. Radio historian <a href="/reading.html#the-intertribal-drum-of-radio">Josh Garrett-Davis points out</a> that Whistler’s ethos carries forward in widespread community radio practices as an anti-hierarchical mode of radio programming.</p>
