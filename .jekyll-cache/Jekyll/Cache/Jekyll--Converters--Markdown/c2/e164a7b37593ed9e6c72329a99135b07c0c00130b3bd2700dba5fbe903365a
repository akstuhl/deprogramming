I"Â<p>Matthew Fuller has been a leading voice in software studies â€“ an interdisplinary movement to explore computer code as a cultural and aesthetic terrain â€“ but the first chapter of his 2005 book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/media-ecologies"><em>Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture</em></a> focuses on radio. In a theory-heavy and experimentally styled treatment of London pirate stations, Fuller shows radio as a medium that enlists many different technologies and demonstrates radioâ€™s ongoing relevance for artistic interrogators of newer digital media. In a particularly useful passage (p.) for our discussion on (de)programming, Fuller explains cultural theorist Stuart Hallâ€™s critique of a sender-receiver communication model and argues that we need to go further in undoing the hylomorphism (separation of form and content) that holds back our understanding of improvistory media systems like pirate radio.</p>
