I"<p>In “The Intertribal Drum of Radio: The <em>Indians for Indians Hour</em> and Native American Media, 1941-1951,” historian Josh Garrett-Davis examines the local and broader cultural impact of radio programmer <a href="listening#the-indians-for-indians-radio-hour">Don Whistler</a>. The article attends to Whistler’s surrounding career and follows an auditory approach to understanding his innovations. Garrett-Davis writes that in “[c]reating <em>Indians for Indians</em>, Whistler turned from the mainstream toward the intertribal studio, where he used modern technology to build a cultural as well as political sovereignty behind walls that muffled what we might call the colonial <em>din</em>” (p. 268) of most media outlets’ representations of Indigenous people.</p>
