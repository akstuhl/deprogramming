<p>Patients with severe Covid may wind up in hospitals or on ventilators until their symptoms resolve. Damage to the body from severe Covid â€” pneumonia, low oxygen, inflammation â€” typically shows up on traditional diagnostic tests.</p>

<p>Long Covid is different: A chronic illness with a wide variety of symptoms, many of which are not explainable using conventional lab tests. Difficulties in detecting the illness have led some doctors to dismiss patients, or to misdiagnose their symptoms as psychosomatic. But researchers looking more deeply at long Covid patients have found visible dysfunction throughout the body.</p>

<p>Studies estimate that perhaps 10 to 30 percent of people infected with the coronavirus may develop long-term symptoms. Itâ€™s unclear why some people develop long Covid and others donâ€™t, but four factors appear to increase the risk: high levels of viral RNA early during an infection, the presence of certain autoantibodies, the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus and having Type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Predators are disappearing rapidly and may no longer be a threat. Humans with severe air blow problems may gather together to breath into tanks. They are sick and perform tests to prove this. Some stay sick, but the tests donâ€™t prove this, and they are not believed. Perhaps they will stay sick and stop eating us.</p>
