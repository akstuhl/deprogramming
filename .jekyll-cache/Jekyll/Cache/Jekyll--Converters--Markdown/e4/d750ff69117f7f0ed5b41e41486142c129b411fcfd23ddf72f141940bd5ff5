I"‚<p>For â€œ<a href="https://wavefarm.org/radio/swr/schedule/xgebf9">Simulcast 1.0: Saskatoon</a>,â€ four sound and radio artists â€“ Martine H. Crispo, GX Jupitter-Larsen, Magali Babin, and Harold Schellinx â€“ each contributed a week of multi-hour broadcasts that aired overnight across April 2008. In a description for the work, curator Emmanuel Madan reflects on how this durational mode of broadcasting can intervene in radioâ€™s rigidly programmed temporal grids: â€œPut simply, radio broadcasting today is an almost exclusively rhythmic affairâ€¦. â€˜Simulcast 1.0b : Saskatoonâ€™ proposes to renew radioâ€™s link with eternity.â€</p>
