I"Û<p>In a short work for his â€œaudio zineâ€ <a href="https://www.jamestgreen.com/u1f60c/hold"><em>U+1F60C</em></a>, James T. Green performs what we might call a deprogramming of a very specific, non-radio audio medium: the Nordstrom department store phone menu. Lighthearted and direct, â€œPlease Holdâ€ lets us hear Green as he encounters the people in the interior of this medium â€“ phone operators and sales clerks â€“ and asks them to invert its usual functioning.</p>
