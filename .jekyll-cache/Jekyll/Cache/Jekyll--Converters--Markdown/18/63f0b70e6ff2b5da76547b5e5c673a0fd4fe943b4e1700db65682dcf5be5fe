<p>In advance of our third session, please draft three short deprogramming prompts (you are welcome to draft more if inspiration strikes). Please send these by <a href="mailto:andykstuhl@gmail.com">email</a> before noon on Monday, Feb. 21 so that we can all view each other‚Äôs work in the session.</p>

<p>Your prompts can address radio or any medium / combination of media you choose. Do not worry if you feel you don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù the format yet: now is the time to experiment and cast a wide net as to how we want to shape this project.</p>

<p>If you are feeling confused, would like some help in drafting your prompts, or otherwise just want to chat, I‚Äôve set up a Calendly page to shcedule one on one meetings. We‚Äôll use the same Zoom link for these as for the workshop sessions.</p>
