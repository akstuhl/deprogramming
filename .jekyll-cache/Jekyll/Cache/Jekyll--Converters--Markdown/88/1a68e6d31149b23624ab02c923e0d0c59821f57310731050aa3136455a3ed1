I"P<p>In a post for the sound studies blog <a href="https://soundstudiesblog.com/2014/03/20/radio-de-accion-violent-circuits-contentious-voices-caribbean-radio-histories/"><em>Sounding Out!</em></a>, Alejandra Bronfman briefly surveys major points from her subsequent book <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469628691/isles-of-noise/"><em>Isles of Noise: Sonic Media in the Caribbean</em></a>. As with the other entries in its containing “Radio de Acción” series on <em>SO!</em>, Bronfman’s post highlights moments when radio was the means and target of urgent political action – in this case, including torture and assassination. These histories imbricate colonial and anti-colonial pressures with contests over cultural and tactical broadcasting, raising the stakes of what it can mean to program or deprogram on one’s own terms.</p>
