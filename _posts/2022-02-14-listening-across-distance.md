### LISTENING ACROSS DISTANCE: TOUCHING/FEELING

by Julia Steinmetz

_For pairs or groups over telephone or video chat_

Begin by listening for your own heartbeat.

Is it a sound or a sensation?

Tap your teeth together. Swallow.

Are you hearing with your ears or your mouth?

Slowly run your finger over the edges of the curves of your ear.

Are you listening to a sound or a texture?

Remember a time when you felt sound with your whole body: on the surface of your skin, in your muscles, in your bones.

Now think of a sound you would like someone else to feel.

Put your fingers against the surface of your headphones or speakers.

Get ready to touch and be touched by sound.

When you are ready, release a sound for others to feel.

Alternate listening with your fingertips and sending out sounds for others to touch and feel.

Allow your focus to glide across the the relational network of sonic
textures.
