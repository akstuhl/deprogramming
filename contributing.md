This website is a collaborative resource and documentation effort for Wave Farm's Radio Deprogramming workshop. Participants are encouraged to help build it by adding works to the listening, reading, and link lists. We will also publish our deprogramming prompts here. Generally speaking, there are two ways to contribute these items: a simple way, and a more hands-on way intended for participants who want to (gently) stretch their web development muscles.
