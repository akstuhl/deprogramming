# Radio Deprogramming

A workshop that was presented through the [Wave Farm Radio Artist Fellowship](https://wavefarm.org/radio/wgxc/calendar/0jewa8) in February 2022 and culminated (for now) in [53 collaboratively authored and recorded media-deprogramming prompts](deprogramming.html).

- What is the nature of the _programming_ that radio programmers do?
- What does it mean for a medium, like radio, to be programmable?
- What can we do when it feels like media want to program _us_?
- What could it mean to **deprogram** radio?
