In a short work for his audio zine [U+1F60C](https://www.jamestgreen.com/u1f60c/hold), James T. Green performs what we might call a deprogramming of a very specific, non-radio audio medium: the Nordstrom department store phone menu. Lighthearted and direct, "Please Hold" lets us hear Green as he encounters the people in the interior of this medium -- call center operators and sales clerks -- and asks them to invert an aspect of its usual functioning.
