Producer Sherre DeLys, writer Rick Moody, and performer John Lurie created [Pirate Radio Station](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/soundproof/pirate-radio-station/6221676) for WNYC's The Next Big Thing. The piece presents a kind of biography for an imagined station that flees from programming conventions. As definitions dissolve into absurdity, the piece's characters and authors all confront the question of what radio could or should be in the absence of imposed structures.
