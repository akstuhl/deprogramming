Participating in both transmission art and speculative fiction, [The Joy Channel](https://iosound.ca/2018/09/iota-001/) is a performance piece in which radio transmissions from various characters reveal a dystopian world and the arrival of a neural-emotional broadcasting technology. Though set more than 100 years into North America's future, The Joy Channel heightens the stakes of an already existing clash between monolithic media corporations' mollifying programming and the subversive or saboteurial efforts of smaller scale broadcasters.
