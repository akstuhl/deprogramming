[St.GIGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.GIGA) is considered the worldâ€™s first digital satellite radio station. Director Hiroshi Yokoi developed a radical broadcast methodology - St.GIGA's broadcasts initially followed no externally fixed timetable. Rather, broadcast themes were approximately matched to the current [tidal cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7eLivrz7HE) throughout the 24-hour broadcasting period. Under this innovative schedule, the station broadcast a variety of primarily ambient music programs, various jazz programs, and live sound-broadcasts of the ocean shore. Between 1995 and 2000, St. GIGA partnered with Nintendo to broadcast video game-related programming to owners of the Super Famicon Satellaview peripheral - this included [video games that could only be played during the live broadcast schedule.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCHRDi-NWVA)
