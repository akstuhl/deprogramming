    <h1>Code of conduct</h1>
    <p>Though our workshop is taking place remotely, we will all benefit from making conscientious efforts to treat each other as respectully as we would in person. This entails listening carefully, making sure criticism is invited and constructive, and setting clear expectations for how we communicate.</p>

<p>Wave Farm is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category; unwelcome recording or image capturing; sustained or targeted disruption of group conversations; and continued one-on-one communication following a request to cease.</p>

<p>We want to hear from you if any situation arises that you feel jeopardizes your ability to safely participate in this workshop. You can reach Andy at <a href="mailto:andykstuhl@gmail.com">andykstuhl@gmail.com</a> or Wave Farm staff at <a href="mailto:info@wavefarm.org">info@wavefarm.org</a>.</p>
