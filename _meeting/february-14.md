Session description to come. Zoom link in email to registered participants.

## Preparing

Please take a listen through the works in our [listening syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/listening.html) in advance of the second session. The audio player at the top of that page will automatically loop through the recorded Radio Naked prompts and some other syllabus excerpts, which might be a good way to background-listen while you wash dishes. I recommend also reading through the text version of Radio Naked.

If you missed the first session or would like a refresher, also please take a look at the [recap](february-07.html).

## Agenda

- Radio Naked discussion
  - Which was your favorite of the 22 prompts?
  - What was confusing?
  - What connections do we see/hear to other works?
  - What questions do we have for Christof Migone?
- Exploring the event score form
  - Sonic meditation 1 (programming): "Listening Across Distance"
  - Sonic meditation 2 (deprogramming): "Inactive Speaker"
- In breakout groups, drafting deprogramming prompts for non-radio media
- Reconvening to share prompts and build a definition for deprogramming
- Planning small group meetings in advance of next session
